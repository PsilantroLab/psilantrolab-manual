# Introduction

**Welcome to the Computational and Translational Neuropsychiatry Lab (PsiLANTRO Lab)**.

This manual was developed by me, Eduardo Garza, lab PI. 

It is intended to be a beginners guide into the lab and to provide my vision of how the lab should function. It is also intended to be a reminder of how to conduct yourself in the lab and with your peers, and to provide information on how to proceed if this code of conduct is not being followed by your peers.

ALL lab members will be expected to read this lab manual. It may update with time.

This manual was inspired by other similar works for example the [Grange-Lab manual](https://bookdown.org/JimGrange/Grange-lab-manual/intro.html). This manual is licence under a [CC Attribution 4.0 Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
